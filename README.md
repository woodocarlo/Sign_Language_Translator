1) the folder sign language and signs include the signs for the words (both folder contain different set of words)
2) from these 2 folders the images were renamed were saved into the main file where they are names as A(1), A(2), B(1) etc. 
3) using the renamed files collages were created of size 5*5 , such that no collage contains the same word twice, however some collage may contain the sign for same word twice.
4) the model was trained on collage images
